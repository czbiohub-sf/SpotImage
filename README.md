# SpotImage

SpotImage is a tool for generating synthetic images with customizable characteristics similar to in situ transcriptomics images. It facilitates experiments with crowdsourced annotator behavior because ground truth in the synthetic images is perfectly known. The user can assign a biologically realistic background image and control characteristics of the spots including number, size, shape, crowdedness, SNR, and distribution across the image.

In the **demo_notebooks** folder, you can explore a notebook which demonstrates usage of the tool.
